This is a cumulative project for all blog entry scala classes.

## Blog Classes

The classes in the global package are worked through and explained in blog posts,
and are not meant to be finished code.  They routinely contain less-optimal code  
to make them concise and easier to explain to the reader.

## Unit Tests

Also included are unit tests, which aren't normally part of the blog entries.
But I do code them, and they may be of help if you want to reuse my approach and
aren't quite sure how to set it up or integrate it into your own code.

## Classes in ca.stevenskelton package

I'll try to fill in this package with versions of blog code that are more appropriate 
for others to reuse.
